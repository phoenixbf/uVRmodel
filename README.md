The μVR model (B. Fanini, CNR ISPC) combines **real-walking** techniques and an adaptive, **multi-scale** gameplay to craft immersive *re-contextualization* applications and 3D puzzles. The model aims to remove/minimize motion sickness while fully exploiting the physical tracked area available.

The very first goal of the μVR Model (and 3D puzzles/applications created on top of it) is to completely remove artificial locomotion techniques (e.g., teleport) by instead exploiting the *physical tracked area* and **real walking** techniques combined with game state and world scale.

## Template project
The template project provides you a VR-ready setup with a sample 3D scene and open-source plugin (C++ and Blueprints) to create your own μVR levels and games.

## Getting started
soon.
